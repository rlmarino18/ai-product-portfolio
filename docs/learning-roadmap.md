# AI/ML Product Learning Roadmap

## Product Vision

Build an **AI/ML Product Portfolio** that demonstrates the ability to identify valuable AI/ML opportunities, understand the underlying technology, evaluate technical approaches, and make evidence-based product decisions.

The portfolio is designed to show that I can operate across product, engineering, data, and business contexts without positioning myself as a ML engineer or AI researcher.

The long-term capability being developed is:

> Identify the right AI/ML problem, select an appropriate technical approach, validate it with evidence, understand its limitations, and determine whether it should be launched, iterated, simplified, or stopped.

---

# Target User

The primary audience for this portfolio is:

- AI Product Management teams
- Applied AI Product teams
- AI Product Strategy teams
- Technical Product organizations
- AI Technical Program Management teams
- hiring managers evaluating technically fluent product talent

The portfolio should provide evidence that I can:

- translate business problems into product requirements
- understand AI/ML architectures at product depth
- prototype enough to test assumptions
- evaluate models and AI systems
- identify failure modes
- reason about quality, cost, latency, risk, and human oversight
- communicate effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders

---

# Core Problem Areas

The portfolio is organized around five recurring AI product problems.

## 1. Where Should AI Be Applied?

Organizations often begin with AI capabilities rather than business problems.

The portfolio should demonstrate the ability to identify:

- high-value workflows
- weak AI opportunities
- automation versus augmentation opportunities
- implementation risks
- expected business value

This problem is addressed primarily through the **AI Workflow Opportunity & ROI Analyzer**.

---

## 2. When Does ML Add Value?

Machine learning introduces additional complexity that is not always justified.

The portfolio should demonstrate the ability to:

- establish deterministic baselines
- evaluate ML against simpler approaches
- identify meaningful performance improvements
- analyze classification errors
- determine when human review remains necessary

This problem is addressed primarily through the **AI Support Triage System**.

---

## 3. Is a Generative AI Product Reliable Enough to Launch?

A functioning LLM or RAG prototype does not automatically represent a launch-ready product.

The portfolio should demonstrate the ability to evaluate:

- retrieval quality
- groundedness
- hallucination
- completeness
- failure behavior
- human escalation
- latency
- cost

This problem is addressed primarily through the **Document Q&A RAG Assistant**, where retrieval quality, grounding, reranking, failure behavior, and evidence quality are evaluated through controlled test cases.

---

## 4. Which AI Configuration Should the Product Use?

AI teams frequently have several technically viable choices.

The portfolio should demonstrate the ability to compare:

- models
- prompts
- retrieval configurations
- system architectures
- quality
- latency
- cost
- reliability

This problem is addressed primarily through the **Executive Brief Generator**, where model behavior, prompt revisions, evaluation criteria, regression testing, and promotion decisions are tested through controlled operational cases.

---

## 5. Where Should AI Autonomy Stop?

Agentic systems introduce product risks beyond simple generation.

The portfolio should demonstrate understanding of:

- tool permissions
- approval boundaries
- retries
- failure handling
- human intervention
- auditability
- governance

This problem is addressed primarily through the **Agentic Workflow Guardrail Simulator**.

---

# Strategic Themes

The roadmap is organized around six strategic capability areas.

## Theme 1 — Technical Foundations

Develop enough software fluency to understand and prototype product behavior.

Core areas:

- Python
- Linux / CLI
- Git / GitHub
- SQL
- HTTP / REST APIs
- JSON

The objective is not programming specialization.

The objective is to independently understand:

- application logic
- data flow
- API behavior
- implementation constraints
- basic debugging
- technical trade-offs

---

## Theme 2 — Data-Informed Product Decisions

Develop the ability to inspect and analyze the data underlying an AI/ML opportunity.

Core areas:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- data cleaning
- exploratory data analysis
- statistics
- experimentation

The objective is to answer:

- What is actually happening?
- How large is the problem?
- What does the baseline look like?
- Is the data reliable?
- Is the data representative?
- Is the data sufficient to support ML?

---

## Theme 3 — ML Product Judgment

Understand predictive ML sufficiently to determine when it creates product value.

Core areas:

- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- feature engineering
- model training
- model evaluation
- error analysis

Key product trade-offs include:

```text
Precision       ↔ Recall
Performance     ↔ Explainability
Complexity      ↔ Maintainability
Automation      ↔ Human Review
Quality         ↔ Cost
```

The objective is not to maximize model performance.

The objective is to determine whether ML meaningfully improves the product.

---

## Theme 4 — Applied AI Product Architecture

Develop practical understanding of modern LLM-based product systems.

Core areas:

- LLM APIs
- prompt engineering
- context engineering
- embeddings
- vector search
- RAG
- tool calling
- agents
- LLM evaluation

The objective is to understand when each architecture is appropriate and when simpler approaches are preferable.

---

## Theme 5 — AI Systems & Production Readiness

Understand the requirements that emerge when an AI prototype becomes an operational product.

Core areas:

- FastAPI
- Docker
- deployment
- observability
- MLOps / LLMOps
- reliability
- latency
- cost optimization
- security
- governance

The objective is to reason about:

- scalability
- reliability
- monitoring
- operational failure
- cost
- security
- human control

---

## Theme 6 — Evaluation & Experimentation

Build the ability to determine whether an AI/ML system is actually good enough to use.

Core areas:

- evaluation datasets
- golden datasets
- controlled experiments
- human evaluation
- LLM-as-judge
- failure analysis
- cost analysis
- latency analysis
- launch criteria

Evaluation should influence product decisions throughout development rather than being treated as a final testing step.

---

# Desired Outcomes

- recall
- F1 score
- retrieval relevance
- groundedness
- hallucination rate
- task success
- latency
- failure rate
- human escalation rate
- cost per request

Thresholds should be defined by the use case rather than treated as universal targets.

---

## Business / Workflow Value

Where applicable, projects should evaluate:

- time saved
- labor reduction
- cost reduction
- workflow throughput
- error reduction
- automation rate
- decision quality
- implementation ROI

---

# Strategic Initiatives

| Initiative | Type | Strategic Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| AI Support Triage System | Supporting | Establish technical baseline and compare rules vs. ML |
| AI Workflow Opportunity & ROI Analyzer | Flagship | Demonstrate AI opportunity discovery and prioritization |
| Document Q&A RAG Assistant | Flagship | Demonstrate retrieval quality, grounding, reranking, evidence evaluation, and launch-readiness decisions |
| Executive Brief Generator | Flagship | Demonstrate AI workflow design, controlled evaluation, regression discipline, human-in-the-loop controls, and product promotion decisions |
| Agentic Workflow Guardrail Simulator | Supporting | Demonstrate autonomy, governance, and human oversight |


---

# Prioritization Logic

Portfolio work should be prioritized based on:

1. **Product relevance** — Does the work strengthen AIML product judgment?
2. **Learning value** — Does it build a capability required by later projects?
3. **Evidence value** — Will it produce something meaningful to discuss or demonstrate?
4. **Technical dependency** — Is the capability required before more advanced work can proceed?
5. **Evaluation value** — Does the work help measure whether an approach actually works?
6. **Effort** — Is the expected learning or portfolio value worth the time required?

A simple prioritization model is:

```text
Priority =
(Product Relevance × Learning Value × Evidence Value × Confidence)
÷ Effort
```

The formula is directional rather than mathematically absolute.

The important question is:

> Why is this the highest-value capability or product problem to work on now?

---

---

# Dependencies

Progress depends on several capability relationships.

```text

        ↓
Data Analysis
        ↓
Machine Learning
        ↓
ML Evaluation
```

```text
Python + APIs
        ↓
LLM Applications
        ↓
RAG / Tool Calling

AI Systems
```

```text
Evaluation Fundamentals
        ↓
RAG Launch Readiness
        ↓
Model Selection

```

Later projects should not bypass foundational understanding simply to produce more impressive-looking applications.

# Key Risks

## Building Before Understanding the Problem

Risk:

Creating technically interesting projects without a meaningful product problem.

Mitigation:

Every featured project begins with:

- target user
- problem
- desired outcome
- measurable success criteria

---

## Using AI Where Simpler Logic Is Better

Risk:

Introducing ML or LLM complexity without proving that it adds value.

Mitigation:

Establish a baseline before adding complexity.

---

## Optimizing for Portfolio Appearance

Risk:

Building visually impressive demos that cannot be explained deeply.

Mitigation:

Prioritize projects that can be defended technically and from a product perspective.

---

## Learning Tools Without Product Application

Risk:

Accumulating disconnected technical knowledge.

Mitigation:

Whenever practical, technical learning should contribute directly to an active project.

---

## Evaluating Only Successful Examples

Risk:

Overestimating system capability because testing focuses on happy paths.

Mitigation:

Evaluation datasets should include:

- edge cases
- failure cases
- ambiguous cases
- invalid inputs
- difficult examples

---

## Over-Automating

Risk:

Removing human review before system reliability supports it.

Mitigation:

Treat human-in-the-loop design as an intentional product architecture decision.

---

# Learning & Validation

Every major initiative should explicitly test assumptions.

Examples:

## AI Support Triage System

Assumption:

> ML will improve triage quality enough to justify added complexity.

Validation:

Compare deterministic rules against a simple classifier using the same evaluation set.

---

### AI Workflow Opportunity & ROI Analyzer

Assumption:

> Workflow characteristics can support useful AI investment recommendations.

Validation:

Run multiple scenarios and test whether the recommendation logic remains consistent and explainable.

---

### Document Q&A RAG Assistant

Assumption:

> Retrieval-augmented generation can provide sufficiently relevant and grounded evidence for document-based question answering.

Validation:

Evaluate retrieval relevance, reranking quality, evidence completeness, grounding, failure behavior, latency, and cost across controlled test cases.

---

### Executive Brief Generator

Assumption:

> A two-stage AI workflow with explicit evaluation, regression testing, and human approval can produce more reliable executive-ready output from messy operational information than direct single-pass generation.

Validation:

Evaluate structured extraction quality, grounding, ownership accuracy, decision-state preservation, approval integrity, unsupported inference, regression behavior, and Stage-2 executive-brief quality across controlled synthetic operational cases.

---

### Agentic Workflow Guardrail Simulator

Assumption:

> An AI workflow can gain useful autonomy without removing necessary human control.

Validation:

Test approval boundaries, permission failures, invalid tool calls, repeated actions, and escalation behavior.

---

# Learning Method

Technical learning should follow:

```text
Explain
    ↓
Demonstrate
    ↓
You Try
    ↓
Diagnose
    ↓
Repeat
    ↓
Apply
    ↓
Explain Back
    ↓
Spaced Repetition
```

The goal is not syntax memorization.

A concept is sufficiently learned when I can:

- recognize it
- explain it
- use it
- debug it
- apply it to a product problem
- explain why one approach was selected over another

---

# Definition of Portfolio Success

The portfolio is successful when it demonstrates that I can move through the full AIML product decision process:

```text
Vision
    ↓
Customer / User
    ↓
Problem
    ↓
Outcome
    ↓
Requirements
    ↓
Baseline
    ↓
Architecture
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Evaluation
    ↓
Failure Analysis
    ↓
Product Recommendation
```

A completed project should be able to answer:

1. Who is the user?
2. What problem are they experiencing?
3. Why is the problem worth solving?
4. What outcome should improve?
5. How will success be measured?
6. What is the existing baseline?
7. Why is AI/ML appropriate?
8. What technical approach was selected?
9. What alternatives were considered?
10. How was the system evaluated?
11. What failure modes were identified?
12. Which errors matter most?
13. Where should humans remain involved?
14. What trade-offs were made?
15. What does the evidence recommend?

The final portfolio should therefore demonstrate more than the ability to build AI/ML systems.

It should demonstrate the ability to decide:

> **what problem is worth solving, why AI/ML is appropriate, what outcome should change, how the solution should be evaluated, and what the evidence says should happen next.**
